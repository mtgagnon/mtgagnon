-Hi, I am Mathurin Gagnon. I am currently a junior student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor studying Computer Science.

-I was a software developer at the University of Michigan Solar Car Team's (https://www.solarcar.engin.umich.edu/) software and strategy branch from September 2021 to September 2022.

-Despite breaking my neck in the summer of 2019 and after excessive amounts of physical therapy, I like to spend my time outside either mountain biking, sailing, swimming, or other outdoor activities when I'm not studying or exercising.

-Currently on the Adaptive Track and Field team working on becoming one of the top adaptive track and field atheletes with aspirations for going to the Paralympics to represent my family and the US.
