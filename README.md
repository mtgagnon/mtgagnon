-Hi, I am Mathurin Gagnon. I am currently a sophomore student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor studying Computer Science.

-I am currently a member of the University of Michigan Solar Car Team's (https://www.solarcar.engin.umich.edu/) software and strategy branch.

-When I'm not studying or coding for the team I like to spend my time outside either mountain biking, sailing, swimming, or other outdoor activities.
-I also love to game and am super excited about Dying Light's sequel coming out soon, since one of my all time favorite games is Dying Light.

-My resume: [resume.pdf](https://github.com/mtgagnon/mtgagnon/files/7316350/resume.pdf)
