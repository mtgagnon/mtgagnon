-Hi, I am Mathurin Gagnon. I am currently a sophomore student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor studying Computer Science.

-I am currently a member of the University of Michigan Solar Car Team's (https://www.solarcar.engin.umich.edu/) software and strategy branch.

-Despite breaking my neck in the summer of 2019 and after excessive amounts of physical therapy, I like to spend my time outside either mountain biking, sailing, swimming, or other outdoor activities when I'm not studying or coding for the team.

-I also love to play video games like Red Dead Redemption 2, Kerbal Space Program, and Dying Light, I am extremely excited about Dying Light's sequel coming out soon, since Dying Light is one of my all time favorite games.
